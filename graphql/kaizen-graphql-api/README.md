**Kaizen GraphQL API** is a monolithic GraphQL service created for [KaizenLAN](https://github.com/narlock/KaizenLAN), serving as an interaction layer for its widgets. This application is built with [Java](https://www.java.com/) using the [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) framework and leverages the [Netflix DGS](https://netflix.github.io/dgs/) library to provide GraphQL functionality.
